Tips‚ö†Ô∏è: Only install the plugins you need and keep your paper collections clear. **Don't be a glutton for punishment by attempting to download all the plugins and archive all the papers.**

### II) Readwise-read
Save everything to one place, highlight like a pro, and replace several apps with Reader.

website: <https://readwise.io/read>

If you always get useful information from X/twitter, YouTube, or Posts, Readwise-read is a good place to collect all of them.

You can use following extension to collect different format elements: <arc://extensions/?id=jjhefcfhmnkfeepcpnilbbkaadhngkbi>

My favorite feature is that you can save YouTube videos and automatically get subtitle scripts for taking notes whenever you want.

## For paper writing

### I) Overleaf

![overleaf.png](overleaf.png){ width=400 }

You can set up a sync with your local files using Git or Dropbox (then you can keep writing when you are offlineü•π): <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Dropbox_Synchronization>

If you are not familiar with LATEX, (and you have enough time), here is a [latex beginners' guide](https://latexguide.org/).

Also, we sweetlyüíó give a overleaf latex template for (AI) paper writing in this project, please check _our paper writing tips_.

### II) Color scheme

### IV) Create Illustrations

#### Drawing boards
* drawio <https://www.drawio.com/>
![drawio.png](drawio.png){ width="400"}
* excalidraw <https://excalidraw.com/>
* ![excalidraw.png](excalidraw.png){ width="400"}
* Lucidchart <www.lucidchart.com/>
* ![lucidchart.png](lucidchart.png){ width="400"}
* any powerpoint applications

#### Icons
* Alibaba Iconfont <https://www.iconfont.cn/>
* icons8 <https://icons8.com/>
![icons8.png](icons8.png){ width="400"}
* iconfinder <https://www.iconfinder.com/>
‚ö†Ô∏è Usually, you can create icons with AI tools(DALL¬∑E, StableDiffusion) that don't involve copyright violations, which is a relatively safer approach.

#### Logos
* VectorLogoZone <https://www.vectorlogo.zone/>
![vectorlogozone.png](vectorlogozone.png){ width="400"}
* Alternatively, you can look for logos from this github Repo <https://github.com/gilbarbara/logos/tree/main>


#### Beautiful tables
* matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/stable/>

  If you want to create beautiful illustrations for your data or results, it is quite useful to follow a demo in Matplotlib. Learn about the colors and formats, and keep refining them with them until you develop your own 'library'.
![matplotlib.png](matplotlib.png){ width="400" }


‚ö†Ô∏èAs a beginner, the fastest way to improve is by consistently emulating others' writing and following their use of beautiful illustrations.

## Create Your Research Clubüéµ

Most junior researchers often feel overwhelmed when it comes to managing their academic projects and notes. In this section, we introduce some useful tools for that.

### I) Notebook

#### For easy online collaboration and sharing

* üåüüåü Notion <https://www.notion.so/>
  ![notion.png](notion.png){ width="400" }
  Students can register with their edu email to enjoy free (and lifelong) educational plans. learn more here: <https://www.notion.so/product/notion-for-education>
  * The best thing about Notion is that you can share your notes publicly without needing to build your own website. (We will provide a guideline on how to create an academic website later.)
    Here is an excellent blog powered by notion <https://yaofu.notion.site/An-Initial-Exploration-of-Theoretical-Support-for-Language-Model-Data-Engineering-Part-1-Pretraini-dc480d9bf7ff4659afd8c9fb738086eb>, written by @[Yao Fu](https://yaofu.notion.site/)
  * You can use notion to :
    * Tracking the progress of your project (you can start with a template <https://www.notion.so/templates>)
    ![racking.png](racking.png){ width="400" }
    * organize all your notes
    ![notionresearchclub.png](notionresearchclub.png){ width="400" }
    * collaboration
    ![sharenotion.png](sharenotion.png){ width="400" }
    * ...
  * feishu/lark  <https://www.larksuite.com/> zh-cn:<https://www.feishu.cn/> 
    * ![feishuweb.png](feishuweb.png){ width="400" }
    * ![feishu.png](feishu.png){ width="400" }
  

#### For private and localize writing
The downside of both of the above applications is that they are difficult to synchronize with local files, and if you must have access to local files to feel secure, [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is recommended!
* obsidian

![obsidian.png](obsidian.png){ width="400" }

![plugins and cavas.png](plugins and cavas.png){ width="400" }

You can set up the sync by the plugin -- remotely save

There are many helpful community plugins, download them in `setting-community plugins`
