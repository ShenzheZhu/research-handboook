# Paper writing from zero

## Preliminary
### I) Choose your writing tools
Generally, we use either **Latex** or **Word** for paper writing, as these are the only two standards currently supported in the toolkit by mainstream conferences (specific examples will be provided later).
⚠️ We highly recommend using **Latex** as main writing tool, it's very convenient and there are many templates available! For the later demonstrations, we build them with Latex.

### II) Prepare your paper template
#### 1. Preprint/Arxiv Style Template
As described in our previous introduction, **Overleaf** is an excellent online Latex editing platform, it also offers diverse paper templates.

* [Arxiv & PRIME AI Style Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/arxiv-and-prime-ai-style-template/qdnhqytdqzsc)
* [Style and Template for Preprints](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/style-and-template-for-preprints-arxiv-bio-arxiv/pkzcrhzcdxmc)

You can directly open those as template in your overleaf. 

#### 2. Conference Style Template
In here, we use the author kit from [AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) 2025](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/) as an example.

After download the Author Kit, unzip it and import the folder Latex(it is the subfolder of CameraReady in AAAI author kit, may be different in other conferences) to Overleaf. Now, you got conference style template in Overleaf.
### III) Familiarize with template folder structure
